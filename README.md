# Postgresql addon for openFrameworks

## About

This addon allows you to add the libpqxx library to your openFrameworks project in an easy way.

## Ubuntu 18.04

The addon assumes you have installed a Postgresql database on your system and have the libpq.so library 
available in your system library path. If not already, you can easily install it with:

```bash
apt install postgresql postgresql-server-dev
```

## macOS

Coming soon...

## Windows

For Windows support, I'm happy to receive a pull request :)

## Documentation

The documentation of the library can be found in `ofxGFPostgresql/libs/doc`.
